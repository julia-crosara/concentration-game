# Concentration 2.0

Project for Udacity's Front-End Developer Nanodegree Program.

Starter code provided some style and structure for the game, but I modified it to taste and built out the app's functionality using JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

# Instructions

Two ways to run the application:

-- Visit https://juliacrosara.github.io/concentration-game/

-- Clone or download the repository and open the index.html file in your browser
