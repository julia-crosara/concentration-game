# Concentration 2.0: A browser-based card matching game

Created for Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree. I built a grid of cards, added functionality to handle user input, and implemented gameplay logic using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the DOM.

# How to play the game

There are 16 squares and 8 pairs of matching icons. Select two squares at time to find the pairs. Keep going until you have matched them all.
