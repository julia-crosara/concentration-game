# Concentration 2.0: A browser-based card matching game

Project for Udacity's Front-End Developer Nanodegree Program.

I built a grid of cards, added functionality to handle user input, and implemented gameplay logic using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the DOM.


# Instructions

Two ways to run the application:

-- Visit https://juliacrosara.github.io/concentration-game/

-- Clone or download the repository and open the index.html file in your browser
