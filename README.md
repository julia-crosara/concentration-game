# Concentration 2.0

I completed this project for Udacity's Front-End Developer Nanodegree Program.

Technically referred to as the Memory Game Project, I nostalgically named it after the original card game that involves flipping over pairs of cards to find a match.

Starter code provided some style and structure for the game, but I modified it to taste and built out the app's functionality using JavaScript.
